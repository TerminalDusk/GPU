# OpenCL.NET
The original OpenCL<sup>TM</sup> library for .NET by CASS.

General information is available [here](http://www.cass-hpc.com/solutions/libraries/opencl-net).

OpenCL.NET provides access to [OpenCL)](http://www.khronos.org/opencl) API from .NET based applications.
Both direct C driver interface is provided, and in addition an OOP (object 
oriented) interface that simplifies coding.

The library uses standard .NET facilities, and therefore can be used on 
Windows, Linux, Mac and other .NET capable operating systems.

The library currently contains definitions for OpenCL API 2.2 (up to), with 
plans to add support for newer revisions.

# Assembly Versions
The .NET assembly of the library follows the same versioning of the supported 
OpenCL API (e.g. 1.1.44.X is compatible with OpenCL 1.1 revision 44).
With the only addition of the last field (revision in .NET terminology), which
denotes internal updates of the library still compatible with same API level.
